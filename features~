After extracting a contour. We expand the contour to a fixed
area size prefarbly, because we defend ourselves at any-angle photographs.

One will notice that maybe we don't want to work on outer contours,
rather we will work on sets of pixels rather than the contour.
This representation is more expensive, BUT will make it easier to capture
the essence of that the bodies actually are not representable with
simply a contour. For instance capital 'A' has a hole in the middle.

With the above undecided in mind we list up the features.

Features:
    * The momentum of the body. (Parameters p,q, maybe 3*3 combinations)
    * Perimetery - 
        This property could be checked both for the outer perimetry
        and the total perimetry, those would be equal for characters
        without wholes in them, like 'L', 'K', etc.
    * Thinness of shape - # erosions to get {}
    * Convexity - maximal (=1) when the object is the same as it's hull
    * Compactness - Large for compact objects, like discs.
